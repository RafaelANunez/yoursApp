## Technical Details

### Data Structures

#### Location History Entry
```javascript
{
  id: "unique-id",
  latitude: 40.7128,
  longitude: -74.0060,
  timestamp: "2025-10-14T09:00:00Z",
  endTimestamp: "2025-10-14T11:30:00Z", // if grouped stay
  duration: 9000, // in seconds, if grouped
  label: "Coffee Shop", // if assigned, null otherwise
  isGrouped: true, // true if this represents a grouped stay
}
```

#### Location Label
```javascript
{
  id: "label-unique-id",
  label: "Home",
  latitude: 40.7128,
  longitude: -74.0060,
  radius: 100, // meters - pings within this radius get this label
  createdAt: "2025-10-14T09:00:00Z",
  updatedAt: "2025-10-14T09:00:00Z"
}
```

#### Settings
```javascript
{
  enabled: false, // default OFF (opt-in)
  updateInterval: 10, // minutes
  autoDeletePeriod: 'never', // or '7days', '30days', '90days', '180days', '365days'
}
```

### Background Location Tracking

The background location tracking is implemented using:
- **Task Manager**: `expo-task-manager` for background task definition
- **Location API**: `expo-location` for GPS tracking
- **Task Name**: `location-history-tracking`
- **Update Interval**: Configurable (default: 10 minutes)
- **Accuracy**: Balanced (good accuracy while preserving battery)
- **Foreground Service**: Runs on Android with notification

The tracking task:
1. Receives location updates based on configured interval
2. Checks if tracking is still enabled
3. Adds location ping using grouping logic
4. Periodically runs auto-delete (every ~10 pings)

### Location Grouping Logic

Consecutive location pings are grouped when:
- Distance between pings â‰¤ 75 meters
- Creates a "stay" with start time, end time, and duration
- Duration is calculated from first to last ping in group

When user moves beyond 75m:
- New location entry is created
- Previous group is finalized with total duration

### Map Implementation

- **Library**: react-native-maps (Google Maps on Android, Apple Maps on iOS)
- **Features**:
  - Markers for each location
  - Polyline connecting locations chronologically
  - Current location marker (distinct color)
  - Marker tap to open labeling modal
  - Initial region centers on first historical location

### Permissions

**iOS**:
- `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription`
- `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`
- `UIBackgroundModes: ["location"]`

**Android**:
- `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`
- `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION`
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION`

All configured in app.json with appropriate descriptions.

## Usage Instructions

### For Users

1. **Enable Location History**:
   - Open the app
   - Tap hamburger menu (â˜°)
   - Tap "Location History"
   - Toggle "Enable Location History" to ON
   - Read and accept the disclosure dialog
   - Grant "Always" location permission when prompted

2. **View Location History**:
   - Access Location History page from hamburger menu
   - Select timeframe filter (Today, Yesterday, Week, Month, Custom)
   - View locations on map or scroll timeline view
   - Tap any marker or timeline item to see details

3. **Label Locations**:
   - Tap a marker on the map or item in timeline
   - Enter a custom label or select a quick label
   - Labels automatically apply to future nearby pings

4. **Configure Settings**:
   - Expand the Settings section
   - Choose update interval (affects battery life)
   - Set auto-delete period if desired

5. **Clear History**:
   - Tap "Clear Location History" button
   - Select timeframe to delete
   - Confirm deletion
   - **Note**: Labels are preserved

### For Developers

1. **Add Location Ping Manually** (for testing):
```javascript
import { addLocationPing } from './utils/locationHistoryStorage';

await addLocationPing(latitude, longitude);
```

2. **Start/Stop Tracking Programmatically**:
```javascript
import {
  startLocationHistoryTracking,
  stopLocationHistoryTracking
} from './utils/locationHistoryTracker';

await startLocationHistoryTracking();
await stopLocationHistoryTracking();
```

3. **Query Location History**:
```javascript
import {
  getLocationHistory,
  filterLocationsByTimeframe
} from './utils/locationHistoryStorage';

const allHistory = await getLocationHistory();
const todayHistory = filterLocationsByTimeframe(allHistory, 'today');
```

- [ ] Disclosure dialog appears on first enable
- [ ] Location permissions requested correctly
- [ ] Background tracking starts when enabled
- [ ] Background tracking stops when disabled
- [ ] Location pings are recorded
- [ ] Location grouping works (visit same spot multiple times)
- [ ] Duration calculated correctly for grouped stays

### UI/UX
- [ ] Map displays with markers
- [ ] Polyline connects markers correctly
- [ ] Current location shows on map
- [ ] Tapping marker opens label modal
- [ ] Timeline view shows correct data
- [ ] Tapping timeline item highlights map location
- [ ] Timeframe filters work correctly
- [ ] Custom date range works

### Location Labels
- [ ] Can add label to location
- [ ] Can edit existing label
- [ ] Can remove label
- [ ] Quick labels work
- [ ] Labels persist after app restart
- [ ] Labels auto-apply to nearby future pings
- [ ] Labels survive history clearing

### Settings
- [ ] Update interval can be changed
- [ ] Changing interval restarts tracking with new interval
- [ ] Auto-delete setting saves correctly
- [ ] Battery warning appears for intervals < 5 minutes

### Clear History
- [ ] Can clear history by timeframe
- [ ] Confirmation dialog appears
- [ ] Labels are preserved after clearing
- [ ] Map and timeline update after clearing

### Permissions & Edge Cases
- [ ] Works on both iOS and Android
- [ ] Handles denied permissions gracefully
- [ ] Works when app is closed
- [ ] Works when screen is locked
- [ ] Handles location services being disabled
- [ ] Handles permission revoked mid-tracking
- [ ] Data persists across app restarts
- [ ] No crashes when location unavailable
- [ ] Performance acceptable with many location pings

### Battery & Performance
- [ ] Battery drain is acceptable (depends on interval)
- [ ] Map renders smoothly with many markers
- [ ] Timeline scrolls smoothly
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] Auto-delete runs periodically

## Known Considerations

1. **Battery Usage**: Background location tracking will drain battery. The default 10-minute interval balances accuracy and battery life. Users should be aware of this.

2. **Storage**: Location history can grow large over time. Auto-delete helps manage this.

3. **Privacy**: All data is stored locally. No data is sent to servers. Users have full control.

4. **Google Maps API**: For production, you may need to configure Google Maps API keys in app.json.

5. **Platform Differences**:
   - iOS shows native location permission dialogs
   - Android requires foreground service notification
   - Permission flows differ between platforms

## Future Enhancements

As noted in the requirements, the following are placeholders for future implementation:

1. **Export to CSV**: Export location history as CSV file
2. **Backup to Cloud**: Backup location data to Google Drive/iCloud
3. **Map Clustering**: For better performance with many markers (react-native-maps-super-cluster)
4. **Route Optimization**: More intelligent route display
5. **Location Search**: Search for specific locations in history
6. **Statistics**: Show stats like total distance traveled, most visited places, etc.

## Navigation Structure

Location History is accessible from:
- Hamburger menu â†’ Location History
- Returns to Home page when back button is pressed
